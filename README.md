# SplatExtractor

A combination of **[splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat)** and **[ZAPD](https://github.com/zeldaret/ZAPD)** + ability to export and pack into a single resource archive (like SoH's [OTRExporter](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/OTRExporter)). This project differs in structure and complementary vision from those projects combined which may or may not be compatible with either of them.

Note that this does not do disassembly related just like splat does, and only extracts supplementary data like textures, N64 display lists, custom structured data, etc. (to which what ZAPD does).

There will be a change of this project name as it confuses me and others thinking what it's actually meant to do.
